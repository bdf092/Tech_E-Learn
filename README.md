# Tech E-Learn

## Data & SQL Project Brief 

Create, deliver and present your own database project. Reflect all major learning outcomes from the course modules from Code Girls First course. There are ‘must have’ core requirements that need to be achieved as a minimum deliverable. 

**Core Requirements**

Create relational  DB of your choice with minimum 5 tables
Set Primary and Foreign Key constraints to create relations between the tables
Using any type of the joins create a view that combines multiple tables in a logical way
In your database, create a stored function that can be applied to a query in your DB
Prepare an example query with a subquery to demonstrate how to extract data from your DB for analysis 
Create DB diagram where all table relations are shown

## Project Idea

An e-learning platform for beginners in technology with courses, career paths, and forum sessions to clarify/answers questions related to the courses and/or tech stack.
